compass","title":"LED compass","body":"In this section, we'll implement a compass using the LEDs on the F3. Like proper compasses, our LED compass must point north somehow. It will do that by turning on one of its eight LEDs; the on LED should point towards north. Magnetic fields have both a magnitude, measured in Gauss or Teslas, and a direction . The magnetometer on the F3 measures both the magnitude and the direction of an external magnetic field but it reports back the decomposition of said field along its axes . See below, the magnetometer has three axes associated to it. Only the X and Y axes are shown above. The Z axis is pointing \"out\" of your screen. Let's get familiar with the readings of the magnetometer by running the following starter code: #![deny(unsafe_code)]\n#![no_std] #[macro_use]\nextern crate aux15; use aux15::prelude::*; fn main() { let (_leds, mut lsm303dlhc, mut delay, mut itm) = aux15::init(); loop { iprintln!(&mut itm.stim[0], \"{:?}\", lsm303dlhc.mag().unwrap()); delay.delay_ms(1_000_u16); }\n} This lsm303dlhc module provides high level API over the LSM303DLHC. Under the hood it does the same I2C routine that you implemented in the last section but it reports the X, Y and Z values in a I16x3 struct instead of a tuple. Locate where north is at your current location. Then rotate the board such that it's aligned \"towards north\": the North LED (LD3) should be pointing towards north.

How could we achieve multitasking in a system with no OS, and thus no threads. There are two main approaches to multitasking: preemptive multitasking and cooperative multitasking. In preemptive multitasking a task that's currently being executed can, at any point in time, be preempted (interrupted) by another task. On preemption, the first task will be suspended and the processor will instead execute the second task. At some point the first task will be resumed. Microcontrollers provide hardware support for preemption in the form of interrupts . In cooperative multitasking a task that's being executed will run until it reaches a suspension point . When the processor reaches that suspension point it will stop executing the current task and instead go and execute a different task. At some point the first task will be resumed. The main difference between these two approaches to multitasking is that in cooperative multitasking yields execution control at known suspension points instead of being forcefully preempted at any point of its execution.","id":"explore.html#multitasking"},"01-background/README.html#background":{"title":"Background","body":"","breadcrumbs":"Background","id":"01-background/README.html#background"},"03-setup/README.html#tools":{"body":"We'll use all the tools listed below.

The complicated part is figuring out the argument of that flag: the name of the target. The microcontroller in the F3 has a Cortex-M4F processor in it. rustc knows how to cross compile to the Cortex-M architecture and provides 4 different targets that cover the different processor families within that architecture: thumbv6m-none-eabi , for the Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M1 processors thumbv7m-none-eabi , for the Cortex-M3 processor thumbv7em-none-eabi , for the Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 processors thumbv7em-none-eabihf , for the Cortex-M4 F and Cortex-M7 F processors For the F3, we'll to use the thumbv7em-none-eabihf target.

Before we use the Bluetooth module with the microcontroller, let's first interact with it using minicom/PuTTY. The first thing we'll need to do is: turn on the Bluetooth module. We'll have to share some of the F3 power to it using the following connection: The recommend steps to wire this up are: Close OpenOCD and itmdump Disconnect the USB cables from the F3 and the serial module. Connect F3's GND pin to the Bluetooth's GND pin using a female to female (F/F) wire. Preferably, a black one. Connect F3's 5V pin to the Bluetooth's VCC pin using a F/F wire. Preferably, a red one. Then, connect the USB cable back to the F3. Re-launch OpenOCD and itmdump Two LEDs, a blue one and a red one, on the Bluetooth module should start blinking right after you power on the F3 board. Next thing to do is pair your laptop and the Bluetooth module. AFAIK, Windows and mac users can simply use their OS default Bluetooth manager to do the pairing.

What's going on? This must be related to the gravity, right? Because the acceleration of gravity is 1 g . But the gravity pulls objects downwards so the acceleration along the Z axis should be negative not positive ... Did the program get the Z axis backwards? Nope, you can test rotating the board to align the gravity to the X or Y axis but the acceleration measured by the accelerometer is always pointing up. What happens here is that the accelerometer is measuring the proper acceleration of the board not the acceleration you are observing. This proper acceleration is the acceleration of the board as seen from a observer that's in free fall. An observer that's in free fall is moving toward the center of the the Earth with an acceleration of 1g ; from its point of view the board is actually moving upwards (away from the center of the Earth) with an acceleration of 1g . And that's why the proper acceleration is pointing up. This also means that if the board was in free fall, the accelerometer would report a proper acceleration of zero.

I mentioned that the F3 actually has two microcontrollers. One of them is used as a programmer/debugger. The part of the board that's used as a programmer is called ST-LINK (that's what STMicroelectronics decided to call it). This ST-LINK is connected to the target microcontroller using a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface (this interface is an ARM standard so you'll run into it when dealing with other Cortex-M based microcontrollers). This SWD interface can be used to flash and debug a microcontroller. The ST-LINK is connected to the \"USB ST-LINK\" port and will appear as a USB device when you connect the F3 to your laptop. As for OpenOCD, it's software that provides some services like a GDB server on top of USB devices that expose a debugging protocol like SWD or JTAG. Onto the actual command: those .cfg files we are using instruct OpenOCD to look for a ST-LINK USB device ( interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg ) and to expect a STM32F3XX microcontroller ( target/stm32f3x.cfg ) to be connected to the ST-LINK.

After the load command, our program is stopped at its entry point . This is indicated by the \"Start address 0x8000XXX\" part of GDB's output. The entry point is the part of a program that a processor / CPU will execute first. The starter project I've provided to you has some extra code that runs before the main function. At this time, we are not interested in that \"pre-main\" part so let's skip right to the beginning of the main function. We'll do that using a breakpoint: (gdb) break led_roulette::main\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x8000218: file src/main.rs, line 8. (gdb) continue\nContinuing.\nNote: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses. Breakpoint 1, led_roulette::main () at src/main.rs:8\n8 let x = 42; Breakpoints can be used to stop the normal flow of a program. The continue command will let the program run freely until it reaches a breakpoint. In this case, until it reaches the main function because there's a breakpoint there. Note that GDB output says \"Breakpoint 1\". Remember that our processor can only use six of these breakpoints so it's a good idea to pay attention to these messages. For a nicer debugging experience, we'll be using GDB's Text User Interface (TUI). To enter into that mode, on the GDB shell enter the following command: (gdb) layout src NOTE Apologies Windows users. The GDB shipped with the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain doesn't support this TUI mode :-( . GDB session At any point you can leave the TUI mode using the following command: (gdb) tui disable OK. We are now at the beginning of main . We can advance the program statement by statement using the step command. So let's use that twice to reach the y = x statement. Once you've typed step once you can just hit enter to run it again. (gdb) step\n9 _y = x; If you are not using the TUI mode, on each step call GDB will print back the current statement along with its line number. We are now \"on\" the y = x statement; that statement hasn't been executed yet. This means that x is initialized but y is not. Let's inspect those stack/local variables using the print command: (gdb) print x\n$1 = 42 (gdb) print &x\n$2 = (i32 *) 0x10001f8c (gdb) print _y\n$3 = -536810104 (gdb) print &_y\n$4 = (i32 *) 0x10001f88 As expected, x contains the value 42 . y , however, contains the value -536810104 (?). Because _y has not been initialized yet, it contains some garbage value. The command print &x prints the address of the variable x . The interesting bit here is that GDB output shows the type of the reference: i32* , a pointer to an i32 value. Another interesting thing is that the addresses of x and _y are very close to each other: their addresses are just 4 bytes apart. Instead of printing the local variables one by one, you can also use the info locals command: (gdb) info locals\nx = 42\n_y = -536810104 OK. With another step , we'll be on top of the loop {} statement: (gdb) step\n12 loop {} And _y should now be initialized. (gdb) print _y\n$5 = 42 If we use step again on top of the loop {} statement, we'll get stuck because the program will never pass that statement. Instead, we'll switch to the disassemble view with the layout asm command and advance one instruction at a time using stepi . NOTE If you used the step command by mistake and GDB got stuck, you can get unstuck by hitting Ctrl+C . (gdb) layout asm GDB session If you are not using the TUI mode, you can use the disassemble /m command to disassemble the program around the line you are currently at. (gdb) disassemble /m\nDump of assembler code for function led_roulette::main:\n6 fn main() { 0x08000216 <+0>: sub sp, #8 7 let _y;\n8 let x = 42; 0x08000218 <+2>: movs r0, #42 ; 0x2a 0x0800021a <+4>: str r0, [sp, #4] 9 _y = x; 0x0800021c <+6>: ldr r0, [sp, #4] 0x0800021e <+8>: str r0, [sp, #0] 10\n11 // infinite loop; just so we don't leave this stack frame\n12 loop {}\n=> 0x08000220 <+10>: b.n 0x8000222 <led_roulette::main+12> 0x08000222 <+12>: b.n 0x8000222 <led_roulette::main+12> End of assembler dump. See the fat arrow => on the left side? It shows the instruction the processor will execute next.

(gdb) stepi\n0x08000222 12 loop {} (gdb) stepi\n0x08000222 12 loop {} One last trick before we move to something more interesting.

The following continue command will let the program run freely until it reaches the main function that has a breakpoint on it. This combo is handy when you, by mistake, skipped over a part of the program that you were interested in inspecting. You can easily roll back the state of your program back to its very beginning. The fine print : This reset command doesn't clear or touch RAM. That memory will retain its values from the previous run. That shouldn't be a problem though, unless your program behavior depends of the value of uninitialized variables but that's the definition of Undefined Behavior (UB).

For convenience, these pins are grouped in ports of 16 pins. Each port is named with a letter: Port A, Port B, etc. and the pins within each port are named with numbers from 0 to 15. The first thing we have to find out is which pin is connected to which LED. This information is in the STM32F3DISCOVERY User Manual (You downloaded a copy, right?). In this particular section: Section 6.4 LEDs - Page 18 The manual says: LD3 , the North LED, is connected to the pin PE9 . PE9 is the short form of: Pin 9 on Port E. LD7 , the East LED, is connected to the pin PE11 . Up to this point, we know that we want to change the state of the pins PE9 and PE11 to turn the North/East LEDs on/off. These pins are part of Port E so we'll have to deal with the GPIOE peripheral. Each peripheral has a register block associated to it. A register block is a collection of registers allocated in contiguous memory. The address at which the register block starts is known as its base address. We need to figure out what's the base address of the GPIOE peripheral. That information is in the following section of the microcontroller Reference Manual : Section 3.2.2 Memory map and register boundary addresses - Page 51 The table says that base address of the GPIOE register block is 0x4800_1000 . Each peripheral also has its own section in the documentation. Each of these sections ends with a table of the registers that the peripheral's register block contains. For the GPIO family of peripheral, that table is in: Section 11.4.12 GPIO register map - Page 243 We are interested in the register that's at an offset of 0x18 from the base address of the GPIOE peripheral. According to the table, that would be the register BSRR . Now we need to jump to the documentation of that particular register. It's a few pages above in: Section 11.4.7 GPIO port bit set/reset register (GPIOx_BSRR) - Page 240 Finally! This is the register we were writing to. The documentation says some interesting things. First, this register is write only ... so let's try reading its value :-) . We'll use GDB's examine command: x . (gdb) next\n13 *(GPIOE_BSRR as *mut u32) = 1 << 9; (gdb) x 0x48001018\n0x48001018: 0x00000000 (gdb) # the next command will turn the North LED on\n(gdb) next\n16 *(GPIOE_BSRR as *mut u32) = 1 << 11; (gdb) x 0x48001018\n0x48001018: 0x00000000 Reading the register returns 0 . That matches what the documentation says. The other thing that the documentation says is that the bits 0 to 15 can be used to set the corresponding pin. That is bit 0 sets the pin 0. Here, set means outputting a high value on the pin. The documentation also says that bits 16 to 31 can be used to reset the corresponding pin. In this case, the bit 16 resets the pin number 0. As you may guess, reset means outputting a low value on the pin. Correlating that information with our program, all seems to be in agreement: Writing 1 << 9 ( BS9 = 1 ) to BSRR sets PE9 high . That turns the North LED on . Writing 1 << 11 ( BS11 = 1 ) to BSRR sets PE11 high . That turns the East LED on . Writing 1 << 25 ( BR9 = 1 ) to BSRR sets PE9 low . That turns the North LED off . Finally, writing 1 << 27 ( BR11 = 1 ) to BSRR sets PE11 low . That turns the East LED off .","id":"07-registers/rtrm.html#rtrm-reading-the-reference-manual","breadcrumbs":"Registers » RTRM: Reading The Reference Manual"},"10-serial-communication/README.html#serial-communication":{"title":"Serial communication","breadcrumbs":"Serial communication","body":"This is what we'll be using. I hope your laptop has one! Nah, don't worry. This connector, the DE-9, when out of fashion on PCs quite some time ago; it got replaced by the Universal Serial Bus (USB). We won't be dealing with the DE-9 connector itself but with the communication protocol that this cable is/was usually used for. So what's this serial communication ? It's an asynchronous communication protocol where two devices exchange data serially , as in one bit at a time, using two data lines (plus a common ground). The protocol is asynchronous in the sense that neither of the shared lines carries a clock signal. Instead both parties must agree on how fast data will be sent along the wire before the communication occurs. This protocol allows duplex communication as data can be sent from A to B and from B to A simultaneously. We'll be using this protocol to exchange data between the microcontroller and your laptop. In contrast to the ITM protocol we have used before, with the serial communication protocol you can send data from your laptop to the microcontroller. The next practical question you probably want to ask is: How fast can we send data through this protocol? This protocol works with frames. Each frame has one start bit, 5 to 9 bits of payload (data) and 1 to 2 stop bits . The speed of the protocol is known as baud rate and it's quoted in bits per second (bps). Common baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bps. To actually answer the question: With a common configuration of 1 start bit, 8 bits of data, 1 stop bit and a baud rate of 115200 bps one can, in theory, send 11,520 frames per second. Since each one frame carries a byte of data that results in a data rate of 11.52 KB/s. In practice, the data rate will probably be lower because of processing times on the slower side of the communication (the microcontroller). Today's laptops/PCs don't support the serial communication protocol. So you can't directly connect your laptop to the microcontroller. But that's where the serial module comes in. This module will sit between the two and expose a serial interface to the microcontroller and an USB interface to your laptop. The microcontroller will see your laptop as another serial device and your laptop will see the microcontroller as a virtual serial device.

Now, we'll implement delays using a hardware timer . The basic function of a (hardware) timer is ... to keep precise track of time. A timer is yet another peripheral that's available to the microcontroller; thus it can be controlled using registers. The microcontroller we are using has several (in fact, more than 10) timers of different kinds (basic, general purpose, and advanced timers) available to it. Some timers have more resolution (number of bits) than others and some can be used for more than just keeping track of time. We'll be using one of the basic timers: TIM6 . This is one of the simplest timers available in our microcontroller. The documentation for basic timers is in the following section: Section 22 Timers - Page 674 - Reference Manual Its registers are documented in: Section 22.4.9 TIM6/TIM7 register map - Page 686 - Reference Manual The registers we'll be using in this section are: SR , the status register. EGR , the event generation register. CNT , the counter register. PSC , the prescaler register. ARR , the autoreload register. We'll be using the timer as a one-shot timer. It will sort of work like an alarm clock. We'll set the timer to go off after some amount of time and then we'll wait until the timer goes off. The documentation refers to this mode of operation as one pulse mode . Here's a description of how a basic timer works when configured in one pulse mode: The counter is enabled by the user ( CR1.CEN = 1 ). The CNT register resets its value to zero and, on each tick, its value gets incremented by one. Once the CNT register has reached the value of the ARR register, the counter will be disabled by hardware ( CR1.CEN = 0 ) and an update event will be raised ( SR.UIF = 1 ). TIM6 is driven by the APB1 clock, whose frequency doesn't have to necessarily match the processor frequency. That is, the APB1 clock could be running faster or slower. The default, however, is that both APB1 and the processor are clocked at 8 MHz. The tick mentioned in the functional description of the one pulse mode is not the same as one tick of the APB1 clock. The CNT register increases at a frequency of apb1 / (psc + 1) times per second, where apb1 is the frequency of the APB1 clock and psc is the value of the prescaler register, PSC ."},"11-usart/README.html#usart":{"title":"USART","breadcrumbs":"USART","id":"11-usart/README.html#usart","body":"The microcontroller has a peripheral called USART, which stands for Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. This peripheral can be configured to work with several communication protocols like the serial communication protocol. Throughout this chapter, we'll use serial communication to exchange information between the microcontroller and your laptop. But before we do that we have to wire up everything. I mentioned before that this protocol involves two data lines: TX and RX. TX stands for transmitter and RX stands for receiver. Transmitter and receiver are relative terms though; which line is the transmitter and which line is the receiver depends from which side of the communication you are looking at the lines. We'll be using the pin PA9 as the microcontroller's TX line and PA10 as its RX line. IOW, the pin PA9 outputs data onto its wire wheres the pin PA10 listens for data on its wire. We could have used a different pair of pins as the TX and RX pins. There's a table in page 44 of the Data Sheet that list all the other possible pins we could have used. The serial module also has TX and RX pins. We'll have to cross these pins: that is connect the microcontroller's TX pin to the serial module's RX pin and the micro's RX pin to the serial module's TX pin. The wiring diagram below shows all the necessary connections. These are the recommended steps to connect the microcontroller and the serial module: Close OpenOCD and itmdump Disconnect the USB cables from the F3 and the serial module. Connect one of F3 GND pins to the GND pin of the serial module using a female to male (F/M) wire. Preferably, a black one.

For example, what LED would you turn on in the following case. EMF stands for Earth's Magnetic Field and green arrow has the direction of the EMF (it points north). The Southeast LED, right? What signs do the X and Y components of the magnetic field have in that scenario? Both are positive. If we only looked at the signs of the X and Y components we could determine to which quadrant the magnetic field belongs to. In the previous example, the magnetic field was in the first quadrant (x and y were positive) and it made sense to turn on the SouthEast LED.

The number that the magnetic_field function reports are unit-less. How can we convert those values to Gauss? The documentation will answer that question. Section 2.1 Sensor characteristics - Page 10 - LSM303DLHC Data Sheet The table in that page shows a magnetic gain setting that has different values according to the values of the GN bits. By default, those GN bits are set to 001 . That means that magnetic gain of the X and Y axes is 1100 LSB / Gauss and the magnetic gain of the Z axis is 980 LSB / Gauss . LSB stands for Least Significant Bits and the 1100 LSB / Gauss number indicates that a reading of 1100 is equivalent to 1 Gauss , a reading of 2200 is equivalent to 2 Gauss and so on. So, what we need to do is divide the X, Y and Z values that the sensor outputs by its corresponding gain . Then, we'll have the X, Y and Z components of the magnetic field in Gauss. With some extra math we can retrieve the magnitude of the magnetic field from its X, Y and Z components: let magnitude = (x * x + y * y + z * z).sqrt(); Putting all this together in a program: #![deny(unsafe_code)]\n#![no_std] #[macro_use]\nextern crate aux15;\nextern crate m; use m::Float; use aux15::prelude::*;\nuse aux15::I16x3; fn main() { const XY_GAIN: f32 = 1100.; // LSB / G const Z_GAIN: f32 = 980.; // LSB / G let (_leds, mut lsm303dlhc, mut delay, mut itm) = aux15::init(); loop { let I16x3 { x, y, z } = lsm303dlhc.mag().unwrap(); let x = f32::from(x) / XY_GAIN; let y = f32::from(y) / XY_GAIN; let z = f32::from(z) / Z_GAIN; let mag = (x * x + y * y + z * z).sqrt(); iprintln!(&mut itm.stim[0], \"{} mG\", mag * 1_000.); delay.delay_ms(500_u16); }\n} This program will report the magnitude of the magnetic field in milligauss ( mG ) because the magnitude of the Earth's magnetic field is in the range of 250 mG to 650 mG (the magnitude varies depending on your geographical location).

TL;DR You have two options to fix this: Either solder the solder bridge SB10 or connect a wire between SWO and PB3 as shown in the picture below. Just a little more of helpful magic before we start doing low level stuff. Blinking an LED is like the \"Hello, world\" of the embedded world. But in this section, we'll run a proper \"Hello, world\" program that prints stuff to your laptop console. Go to the 06-hello-world directory. There's some starter code in it: #![deny(unsafe_code)]\n#![no_std] #[macro_use]\nextern crate aux6; fn main() { let mut itm = aux6::init(); iprintln!(&mut itm.stim[0], \"Hello, world!\");\n} The iprintln macro will format messages and output them to the microcontroller's ITM . ITM stands for Instrumentation Trace Macrocell and it's a communication protocol on top of SWD (Serial Wire Debug) which can be used to send messages from the microcontroller to the debugging host. This communication is only one way : the debugging host can't send data to the microcontroller. OpenOCD, which is managing the debug session, can receive data sent through this ITM channel and redirect it to a file. The ITM protocol works with frames (you can think of them as Ethernet packets). Each frame has a header and a variable length payload. OpenOCD will receive these frames and write them directly to a file without parsing them. So, if the microntroller sends the string \"Hello, world!\" using the iprintln macro, OpenOCD's output file won't exactly contain that string. To retrieve the original string, OpenOCD's output file will have to be parsed. We'll use the itmdump program to perform the parsing as new data arrives. You should have already installed the itmdump program during the installation chapter . In a new terminal, run this command inside the /tmp directory, if you are using a *nix OS, or from within the %TEMP% directory, if you are running Windows. This should be the same directory from where you are running OpenOCD. It's very important that both itmdump and openocd are running from the same directory! $ # itmdump terminal $ # *nix\n$ cd /tmp && touch itm.txt $ # Windows\n$ cd %TEMP% && type nul >> itm.txt $ # both\n$ itmdump -F -f itm.txt This command will block as itmdump is now watching the itm.txt file. Leave this terminal open. Alright. Now, let's build the starter code and flash it into the microcontroller. To avoid passing the --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf flag to every Xargo invocation we can set a default target in .cargo/config: [target.thumbv7em-none-eabihf] runner = \"arm-none-eabi-gdb\" rustflags = [ \"-C\", \"link-arg=-Tlink.x\", \"-C\", \"linker=arm-none-eabi-ld\", \"-Z\", \"linker-flavor=ld\", ] +[build]\n+target = \"thumbv7em-none-eabihf\" Now if --target is not specified Xargo / Cargo will assume that the target is thumbv7em-none-eabihf . $ xargo run\nReading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/hello-world...done.\n(..)\n0x00000000 in ??

It's pretty similar to the one we used in the previous section. Before we execute the iprintln! statement. We have to instruct OpenOCD to redirect the ITM output into the same file that itmdump is watching. (gdb) # globally enable the ITM and redirect all output to itm.txt\n(gdb) monitor tpiu config internal itm.txt uart off 8000000 (gdb) # enable the ITM port 0\n(gdb) monitor itm port 0 on All should be ready!

In general, PWM can be used to control how much power is given to some electric device. With proper (power) electronics between a microcontroller and an electrical motor, PWM can be used to control how much power is given to the motor thus it can be used to control its torque and speed.

And if you compiled in release mode, you probably only got something like this: $ # minicom's terminal\n(..)\nT What went wrong? You see, sending bytes over the wire takes a relatively large amount of time. I already did the math so let me quote myself: With a common configuration of 1 start bit, 8 bits of data, 1 stop bit and a baud rate of 115200 bps one can, in theory, send 11,520 frames per second. Since each one frame carries a byte of data that results in a data rate of 11.52 KB/s Our pangram has a length of 45 bytes. That means it's going to take, at least, 3,900 microseconds ( 45 bytes / (11,520 bytes/s) = 3,906 us ) to send the string. The processor is working at 8 MHz, where executing an instruction takes 125 nanoseconds, so it's likely going to be done with the for loop is less than 3,900 microseconds. We can actually time how long it takes to execute the for loop. aux11::init() returns a MonoTimer (monotonic timer) value that exposes an Instant API that's similar to the one in std::time . #![no_std] #[macro_use]\nextern crate aux11; fn main() { let (usart1, mono_timer, mut itm) = aux11::init(); let instant = mono_timer.now(); // Send a string for byte in b\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\".iter() { usart1.tdr.write(|w| w.tdr().bits(u16::from(*byte))); } let elapsed = instant.elapsed(); // in ticks iprintln!( &mut itm.stim[0], \"`for` loop took {} ticks ({} us)\", elapsed, elapsed as f32 / mono_timer.frequency().0 as f32 * 1e6 );\n} In debug mode, I get: $ # itmdump terminal\n(..)\n`for` loop took 22823 ticks (2852.875 us) This is less than 9,500 microseconds but it's not that far off and that's why only a few bytes of information are lost. In conclusion, the processor is trying to send bytes at a faster rate than what the hardware can actually handle and this results in data loss. This condition is known as buffer overrun . How do we avoid this? The status register ( ISR ) has a flag, TXE , that indicates if it's \"safe\" to write to the TDR register without incurring in data loss. Let's use that to slowdown the processor. fn main() { let (usart1, mono_timer, mut itm) = aux11::init(); let instant = mono_timer.now(); // Send a string for byte in b\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\".iter() { // wait until it's safe to write to TDR while usart1.isr.read().txe().bit_is_clear() {} usart1.tdr.write(|w| w.tdr().bits(u16::from(*byte))); } let elapsed = instant.elapsed(); // in ticks iprintln!( &mut itm.stim[0], \"`for` loop took {} ticks ({} us)\", elapsed, elapsed as f32 / mono_timer.frequency().0 as f32 * 1e6 );\n} This time, running the program in debug or release mode should result in a complete string on the receiving side. $ # minicom/PuTTY's console\n(..)\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

It's a widely used protocol because it's very simple and this simplicity makes it easy to implement on top of other protocols like Bluetooth and USB. However, it's simplicity is also a downside. More elaborated data exchanges, like reading a digital sensor, would require the sensor vendor to come up with another protocol on top of it. (Un)Luckily for us, there are plenty of other communication protocols in the embedded space. Some of them are widely used in digital sensors. The F3 board we are using has three motion sensors in it: an accelerometer, a magnetometer and gyroscope. The accelerometer and magnetometer are packaged in a single component and can be accessed via an I2C bus. I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit and is a synchronous serial communication protocol. It uses two lines to exchange data: a data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). Because a clock line is used to synchronize the communication, this is a synchronous protocol. This protocol uses a master slave model where the master is the device that starts and drives the communication with a slave device. Several devices, both masters and slaves, can be connected to the same bus at the same time. A master device can communicate with a specific slave device by first broadcasting its address to the bus. These address can be 7 bits or 10 bits long. Once a master has started a communication with a slave, no other device can make use of the bus until the master stops the communication. The clock line determines how fast data can be exchanged and it usually operates at a frequency of 100 KHz (standard mode) or 400 KHz (fast mode).","id":"14-i2c/README.html#i2c","breadcrumbs":"I2C","title":"I2C"},"10-serial-communication/nix-tooling.html#minicom":{"breadcrumbs":"Serial communication » minicom","body":"Dealing with serial devices using echo is far from ergonomic.

A microcontroller is much cheaper than a general purpose computer. Not only the microcontroller is cheaper; it also requires much less external electrical components to operate. This makes Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) smaller and cheaper to design and manufacture. The other big reason is power consumption. A microcontroller consumes orders of magnitude less power than a full blown processor. If your application will run on batteries that makes a huge difference. And last but not least: (hard) real time constraints. Some processes require their controllers to respond to some events within some time interval (e.g. a quadcopter/drone hit by a wind gust). If this deadline is not met, the process could end in catastrophic failure (e.g. the drone crashes to the ground). A general purpose computer running a general purpose OS has many services running in the background.

Each Led represents one of the LEDs on the F3 board, and exposes two methods: on and off which can be used to turn the LED on or off, respectively.

How big is your solution? You can check that using the size command on the release binary: $ arm-none-eabi-size target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/*/led-roulette text data bss dec hex filename 20474 0 4 20478 4ffe target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette 2148 0 4 2152 868 target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/led-roulette NOTE The Cargo project is already configured to build the release binary using LTO. Know how to read this output? The text section contains the program instructions. It's around 2KB in my case. On the other hand, the data and bss sections contain variables statically allocated in RAM ( static variables). A static variable is being used in aux5::init ; that's why it shows 4 bytes of bss . One final thing! We have been running our programs from within GDB but our programs don't depend on GDB at all. You can confirm this be closing both GDB and OpenOCD and then resetting the board by pressing the black button on the board. The LED roulette application will run without intervention of GDB.","breadcrumbs":"LED roulette » My solution","id":"05-led-roulette/my-solution.html#my-solution","title":"My solution"},"07-registers/type-safe-manipulation.html#type-safe-manipulation":{"body":"The last register we were working with, ODR , had this in its documentation: Bits 16:31 Reserved, must be kept at reset value We are not supposed to write to those bits of the register or Bad Stuff May Happen. There's also the fact the registers have different read/write permissions. Some of them are write only, others can be read and wrote to and there must be others that are read only. Finally, directly working with hexadecimal addresses is error prone. You already saw that trying to access an invalid memory address causes an exception which disrupts the execution of our program. Wouldn't it be nice if we had an API to manipulate registers in a \"safe\" manner? Ideally, the API should encode these three points I've mentioned: No messing around with the actual addresses, should respect read/write permissions and should prevent modification of the reserved parts of a register. Well, we do! aux7::init() actually returns a value that provides a type safe API to manipulate the registers of the GPIOE peripheral. As you may remember: a group of registers associated to a peripheral is called register block, and it's located in a contiguous region of memory. In this type safe API each register block is modeled as a struct where each of its fields represents a register. Each register field is a different newtype over e.g. u32 that exposes a combination of the following methods: read , write or modify according to its read/write permissions. Finally, these methods don't take primitive values like u32 , instead they take yet another newtype that can be constructed using the builder pattern and that prevent the modification of the reserved parts of the register. The best way to get familiar with this API is to port our running example to it. #![no_std] extern crate aux7; fn main() { let gpioe = aux7::init().1; // Turn on the North LED gpioe.bsrr.write(|w| w.bs9().set_bit()); // Turn on the East LED gpioe.bsrr.write(|w| w.bs11().set_bit()); // Turn off the North LED gpioe.bsrr.write(|w| w.br9().set_bit()); // Turn off the East LED gpioe.bsrr.write(|w| w.br11().set_bit());\n} First thing you notice: There are no magic addresses involved. Instead we use a more human friendly way, for example gpioe.bsrr , to refer to the BSRR register in the GPIOE register block. Then we have this write method that takes a closure. If the identity closure ( |w| w ) is used, this method will set the register to its default (reset) value, the value it had right after the microcontroller was powered on / reset. That value is 0x0 for the BSRR register. Since we want to write a non-zero value to the register, we use builder methods like bs9 and br9 to set some of the bits of the default value. Let's run this program! There's some interesting stuff we can do while debugging the program. gpioe is a reference to the GPIOE register block. print gpioe will return the base address of the register block. $ xargo run (gdb) next (gdb) print gpioe\n$1 = (stm32f30x::gpioc::RegisterBlock *) 0x48001000 But if we instead print *gpioe , we'll get a full view of the register block: the value of each of its registers will be printed. (gdb) print *gpioe\n$2 = stm32f30x::gpioc::RegisterBlock { moder: stm32f30x::gpioc::MODER { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x55550000 } } }, otyper: stm32f30x::gpioc::OTYPER { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, ospeedr: stm32f30x::gpioc::OSPEEDR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, pupdr: stm32f30x::gpioc::PUPDR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, idr: stm32f30x::gpioc::IDR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0xcc } } }, odr: stm32f30x::gpioc::ODR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, bsrr: stm32f30x::gpioc::BSRR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, lckr: stm32f30x::gpioc::LCKR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, afrl: stm32f30x::gpioc::AFRL { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, afrh: stm32f30x::gpioc::AFRH { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }, brr: stm32f30x::gpioc::BRR { register: vcell::VolatileCell<u32> { value: core::cell::UnsafeCell<u32> { value: 0x0 } } }\n} All these newtypes and closures sound like they'd generate large, bloated programs but, if you actually compile the program in release mode with LTO enabled, you'll see that it produces exactly the same instructions that the \"unsafe\" version that used write_volatile and hexadecimal addresses did! $ xargo build --release $ arm-none-eabi-objdump -Cd target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/registers\n08000864 <cortex_m_rt::reset_handler::main>: 8000864: b580 push {r7, lr} 8000866: 466f mov r7, sp 8000868: f240 1088 movw r0, #392 ; 0x188 800086c: f6c0 0000 movt r0, #2048 ; 0x800 8000870: 7800 ldrb r0, [r0, #0] 8000872: f7ff fe69 bl 8000548 <aux7::init> 8000876: f241 0018 movw r0, #4120 ; 0x1018 800087a: f44f 7100 mov.w r1, #512 ; 0x200 800087e: f6c4 0000 movt r0, #18432 ; 0x4800 8000882: 6001 str r1, [r0, #0] ; <- 8000884: f44f 6100 mov.w r1, #2048 ; 0x800 8000888: 6001 str r1, [r0, #0] ; <- 800088a: f04f 7100 mov.w r1, #33554432 ; 0x2000000 800088e: 6001 str r1, [r0, #0] ; <- 8000890: f04f 6100 mov.w r1, #134217728 ; 0x8000000 8000894: 6001 str r1, [r0, #0] ; <- 8000896: bd80 pop {r7, pc} The best part of all this is that I didn't have to write a single line of code to implement the GPIOE API. All was automatically generated from a System View Description (SVD) file using the svd2rust tool. This SVD file is actually an XML file that microcontroller vendors provide and that contains the register maps of their microcontrollers. The file contains the layout of register blocks, the base addresses, the read/write permissions of each register, the layout of the registers, whether a register has reserved bits and lots of other useful information.","id":"07-registers/type-safe-manipulation.html#type-safe-manipulation","breadcrumbs":"Registers » Type safe manipulation","title":"Type safe manipulation"},"01-background/README.html#what-can-you-do-with-a-microcontroller":{"body":"Lots of things!

The other common trait of these systems is that they control a process. And for that these systems usually have one or more sensors and one or more actuators.

Your goal is to make this line of code work: uprintln!(\"The answer is {}\", 40 + 2) Which must send the string \"The answer is 42\" through the serial interface. How do we go about that? It's informative to look into the std implementation of println! . // src/libstd/macros.rs\nmacro_rules! print { ($($arg:tt)*) => ($crate::io::_print(format_args!($($arg)*)));\n} Looks simple so far. We need the built-in format_args! macro (it's implement in the compiler so we can't see what it actually does). We'll have to use that macro in the exact same way. What does this _print function do? // src/libstd/io/stdio.rs\npub fn _print(args: fmt::Arguments) { let result = match LOCAL_STDOUT.state() { LocalKeyState::Uninitialized | LocalKeyState::Destroyed => stdout().write_fmt(args), LocalKeyState::Valid => { LOCAL_STDOUT.with(|s| { if s.borrow_state() == BorrowState::Unused { if let Some(w) = s.borrow_mut().as_mut() { return w.write_fmt(args); } } stdout().write_fmt(args) }) } }; if let Err(e) = result { panic!(\"failed printing to stdout: {}\", e); }\n} That looks complicated but the only part we are interested in is: w.write_fmt(args) and stdout().write_fmt(args) . What print! ultimately does is call the fmt::Write::write_fmt method with the output of format_args! as its argument. Luckily we don't have to implement the fmt::Write::write_fmt method either because it's a default method. We only have to implement the fmt::Write::write_str method. Let's do that. This is what the macro side of the equation looks like. What's left to be done by you is provide the implementation of the write_str method. Above we saw that Write is in std::fmt .
